				<h1 class="det-win-title">Van Gogh Mural</h1>
				<h5 class="det-win-title">Activity</h5>
					<p class="det-text">Students in the work oriented training path will be practicing their soft skills all whilst taking in consideration a client’s request (school principal) for a mural. They will receive daily tasks to complete. These will become less and less strict as the project goes on in order to help students develop effective work methods more independently. </p>
				<h5 class="det-win-title">Lessons Overview</h5>
					<p class="det-text">Step 1: Introduction of impressionism and symbolism in art. Students explore the theme of a room in the school (the oasis, a room where they can relax or calm down during a crisis).
					<br>Step 2: Mixing of colors and tracing of the sketch on the wall with a projector. Preparation of the room (masking tape, tarps, and placing of tools and materials to be used) and distribution of student tasks.
					<br>Step 3: Painting of the background and delimitation of te areas to be painted.
					<br>Step 4: Painting gestural dry brush strokes to add texture in all the sections in Van Gogh's style.
					<br>Step 5: Adding details and embellishments, giving more freedom of creativity and choice to students (frame, starfish, seaweed...).
					<br>Step 6: Full clean-up of the room, final touch-ups, taking pictures, and official opening of the oasis.</p>

				<h1 class="det-win-title">Fantasy Mountains</h1>
				<h5 class="det-win-title">Activity</h5>
					<p class="det-text">This unit was designed to challenge DEFIS students’ preconceived ideas of what art looks like. What makes an artwork successful? What is beautiful about my own art and about my peers’ art? Does art have to look realistic in order to be considered beautiful?</p>

					<br>Lesson 3: Follow-up on abstraction, different brush strokes, color theory, and introduction of texture. Students choose one or more new tools to add texture to their piece.
					<br>Lesson 4: Follow-up on all the previous concepts and introduction of patterns. Students choose at least one area in their mountains where they add a pattern.
					<br>Lesson 5: Reitaration of all concepts and techniques, final touch-ups, and relfection and appreciation of the created artwork using provided handouts.</p>
				<h5 class="det-win-title">Learning Objectives</h5>

					<p class="det-text">What is an inequality or issue in the world that I would like to change? How can we share our ideas and create a piece of art that shows collectivity and that represents us as a group? Students create 4 prints on fabric inspired by these prompts.</p>
				<h5 class="det-win-title">Lessons Overview</h5>
					<p class="det-text">Lesson 1: Students engage in brainstorming processes. How does creating in a group differ from creating individually? What do I want to change in the world? They get inspired by other students' contributions when completing the handouts.

					<br>Lesson 3-4: Choice of fabrics and colors of paint. Preparation of the fabric squares and printing of the images.
					<br>Lesson 5: Digital mapping of the banner. Students get in groups and create mockups of the future banner with the collected pictures of each student.
